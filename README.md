# Firewall Simulation

A small, menu-driven Python firewall simulator that lets you define allow/deny rules and test sample packets against them. The script logs each rule change and packet decision to `firewall.log`.

## Features
- Add and delete firewall rules interactively.
- Evaluate packets from a JSON file against the configured rules.
- Log rule changes and packet decisions for auditing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (standard library only)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   python firewall.py
   ```

## Usage
When you run the script, you will see an interactive menu:

1. Add Rule
2. Delete Rule
3. Show Rules
4. Process Packets
5. Exit

### Adding a Rule
Provide the action (`allow` or `deny`), source/destination IPs (or `*` for wildcard), protocol (`TCP` or `UDP`), and destination port (number or `*`). The rule is appended to the in-memory rules list.

### Deleting a Rule
Enter the numeric index shown in **Show Rules** to remove a rule.

### Processing Packets
`packets.json` contains example packets. Option **4** processes them through the rules and prints whether each packet is allowed or denied. The same results are logged in `firewall.log`.

## Project Files
- `firewall.py` - Main simulation script.
- `packets.json` - Sample packet data for processing.
- `firewall.log` - Log output generated by the simulator.

## Notes
- Rules are stored in memory for the current session only. Restarting the script resets the rules to the defaults defined in `firewall.py`.
